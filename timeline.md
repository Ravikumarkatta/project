## Development Approach

Throughout all phases of development, we will follow these principles:

1. **Theological Accuracy**: All features undergo theological validation before release
2. **Iterative Development**: Regular releases with incremental improvements
3. **User Feedback**: Continuous collection and integration of user input
4. **Code Quality**: Maintain high standards through testing and code reviews
5. **Documentation**: Keep documentation updated alongside development
6. **Security**: Regular security audits and best practices implementation

## Current Status

We are currently in Phase 1, focusing on establishing the foundation of the Bible-AI platform. Core data processing and model architecture components are under active development.
