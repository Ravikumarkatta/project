# Bible-AI Theological Basis

This document outlines the theological foundations, principles, and approaches that guide the Bible-AI system.

## Core Theological Commitments

Bible-AI is built upon several foundational theological commitments:

1. **Scripture as Authority**: We recognize the Bible as the authoritative word of God and the primary source for theological understanding.

2. **Hermeneutical Responsibility**: We are committed to interpreting Scripture according to sound hermeneutical principles that respect the text's historical, cultural, and literary context.

3. **Theological Humility**: We acknowledge that many theological questions have multiple legitimate interpretations across Christian traditions.

4. **Pastoral Sensitivity**: We approach difficult theological topics with compassion and awareness of their personal impact.

5. **Academic Integrity**: We engage seriously with biblical scholarship while maintaining evangelical commitments.

## Hermeneutical Approach

Bible-AI employs the following interpretive principles:

### Contextual Interpretation
- **Historical Context**: Understanding the historical situation of the biblical authors and audience
- **Cultural Context**: Recognizing cultural backgrounds that inform the text's meaning
- **Literary Context**: Reading passages within their broader literary units
- **Canonical Context**: Interpreting individual passages in light of the whole Bible

### Textual Analysis
- **Genre Awareness**: Applying appropriate interpretive strategies based on biblical genres (narrative, poetry, epistle, etc.)
- **Original Languages**: Consulting Hebrew and Greek meanings when necessary
- **Literary Devices**: Recognizing metaphor, hyperbole, and other literary techniques

### Theological Interpretation
- **Scripture Interprets Scripture**: Using clearer passages to help understand less clear ones
- **Christocentric Reading**: Recognizing Christ as the center of biblical revelation
